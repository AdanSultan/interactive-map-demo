# 🌍 Interactive Route Map Demo

A clean and interactive **map demo** that allows users to select starting and destination points from dropdown menus — and view the route instantly on a dynamic map.

Built using **Leaflet.js**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this demo showcases how to create an elegant, responsive, and fully customizable route visualization for web applications.

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

1. Select **“From”** and **“To”** locations from dropdown menus.  
2. The map automatically updates, drawing a **blue route line** between both points.  
3. Each location is marked with a popup marker that displays its name.  
4. The route and view adjust dynamically using Leaflet’s `fitBounds()` method.
