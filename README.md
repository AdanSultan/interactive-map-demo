## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user selects a **starting** and **destination** point from dropdown menus.  
2. The system retrieves coordinates from a predefined dataset (can be connected to an API).  
3. **Leaflet.js** dynamically plots the route between both points on the map.  
4. Interactive markers appear with popups showing location names.  
5. The map auto-zooms and centers to fit the selected route perfectly.
